Fault Injetor Software Based (FISBE)

Soft error is a concern for the development of spacial applications. Single Event Effects
produced by radiation particles in eletronic circuits can produce unpredicable behaviour.

Fault tolerance algorithms have been studied in the literature to increase
the system reliability. Normally to simulate such conditions and evaluate possible solutions
the use of dedicated equipments or hardware description simulation are alternatives.

However in project time sometimes there's no available resources to emulate radiation conditions. 
In addition, the use of hardware description to inject faults and emulate SEE can be limited by the complexity
of the application. A complex operational system like Linux can increase the simulation time ...
